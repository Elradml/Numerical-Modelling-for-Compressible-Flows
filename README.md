# Numerical-Modelling-for-Compressible-Flows

The Fortran code here is part of an assignment investigating different Godunov methods for the 1D compressible Euler equation of ideal gases.
Students were given the full code with a completed Lax-Friedrichs subroutine but empty subroutines for the Rusanov, HLL, and HLLC to complete.
The 1st and 2nd order results from the 4 methods were compared to investigate their accuracy and stability.
